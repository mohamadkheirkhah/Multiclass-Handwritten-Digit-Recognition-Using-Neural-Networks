Multi-class Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Neural Networks
Overview
This project focuses on implementing a neural network for recognizing hand-written digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset. The neural network is designed to perform multiclass classification, where the goal is to correctly classify each handwritten digit into one of the ten possible categories.
